A Californian Sends a Postcard Back

Cirrus floccus are crystal feathers short of wings
and most are scattered in their markings

I have never seen angels gather some, but
sometimes they shine through UV-glycation.

Mist is when the night is tired of storm drains
and greets with blanket full of engravings

the world still walks on the tick-tock, in hope
to grind the coffee grounds into compost,

Cold is when mountains whitecap in sierra
and alpine lake sips all of the waves

sun takes on the dreaming, and all the clocks
time travel an hour ahead

I-PACE is a car with many yes, and tongue
that can touch the road fifty feet

come ride inside or beside, in the magic
for the daughters to shout - "ghost car"!


Some of us proudly live on the streets, as
streets have forgotten to ask for rent

for evolution, to train the replacement
with bots that would not love nor mate

but love is worn on the wrist,
or kept in a box, the only acceptable crime.

In homes, a haunted apparatus sweeps, mops, 
and fold cloths or make rotis

all with shiny flat faces, teaching kids
how to run 60 seconds’ worth in a minute

Kids do not get beat, but no Wi‑Fi
is harsher punishment to the druggies

they get cars at 16 and vapes at 13,
jobs at 26 and probably never marry

Death Valley is never near a death
and too large to be a valley, where

the sunset reflected twice on clouds
and ended up enchanting the peak on the east

I heard you live in the mud, red and pink
where diamonds soar the sky, to pluck the wings

6 minutes’ lag on FaceTime, and no return ticket
is a strange reality

so we stare at this awkward pause, echoing
send another postcard before the citrus bloom
