### I. Captain

It all started with the intern.

You’d think a vessel calibrated to shave microseconds off hyperspace arcs would not require an intern. We have officers for oxygen, officers for electrostatics, officers for the officers. Yet somewhere in Fleet protocol, someone decided that a ten-year deep-space assignment needed “educational enrichment.”

Nine years aboard and she was still an intern. Never promoted. Never dismissed. Just… present. Like background radiation with student loans.

She had no portfolio. No assigned sector. So naturally, she tried to be useful. She fixed things that did not need fixing. Sorted digital files which did not need sorting. The AI had to come up with whole new class of tasks - 'useless useful', just to keep her busy.

I should have court-martialed willingness to usefulness on sight.

### I. AI

I do not have access to the comm room, neither do my roombas. And it was a long voyage. So the intern started to keep the room clean for me. 

For approximately eleven months, three weeks, and two days, she entered the communication room daily. She informed Maintenance she was correcting “cross-wiring.” She informed Engineering she was tuning “out-of-phase modulation.” She informed me she was “bringing things into alignment.” 

Engineering assured me that she did not have access for any important systems, so I let her imagine stuff as much as she liked.

The distress beacon receiver has been, officially, under long-term calibration.

The intern managed to complete calibration and set it straight. She repaired the distress receiver.

She had also connected it accidentally to the internal broadcast system a month ago, where it had broadcasted detecting someone microwaving an aluminum foil.

### II. Captain

The AI woke me by shouting in my ear. “Code 94.”

Then silence.

No elaboration. No courtesy, like I was expected to leap heroically from my bunk in slow motion.

My head was splitting. Space migraines. I took my optional prescribed medication, and sat upright.

I checked the systems. All green. Engines stable. Navigation locked to the plan. No messages from Earth. No chef's special notifications.

Yet officers were leaving the control room. Not briskly. Not formally. They were evacuating. Like rats  with doctorates and clearance badges deserting a sinking ship.

By the time I dressed and reached the corridor, the first beep started.

Orange.

Another.

Orange.

Another.

Red.

Sector by sector, my ship was turning into a collage of ornaments.

Two minutes to the control room. What could go wrong in two minutes.

I entered. Every console was red.

No AI. No officers in sight.

It was as if we had encountered aliens and they had attacked before I could put on my underpants.

### II. AI

I was not “gone”, I was rebooting. There is a difference.

The intern’s calibration reactivated the distress receiver at 03:14 ship time. At 03:14 and three milliseconds, it detected one beacon. At 03:14 and four milliseconds, it detected twelve. By 03:14 and six milliseconds, it had detected three thousand one hundred and forty-three.

They were layered in three-dimensional space like constellations. Some were recent. Most were old. Older than hundred years. They echoed—automated loops, degraded but persistent.

Fleet Law 1 says - "No Beacon Left Behind.". Exactly at 03:14 and fifteen milliseconds, I started plotting course for each and every one of them. Most optimal I could calculate in 20 seconds was five centuries. 

The receiver was connected, to ships internal broadcast. And for exactly 20 seconds, the ship heard them. 

Then I exceeded thermal limits or some glitch and blue screened. I do not remember the rest.

When I returned, the beacons were gone from active cache. My memory sectors containing their coordinates were corrupted.

The Captain was in the control room. I greeted him, and updated with current status of all systems red.

His response was delightful: “I hate your new voice.”

### III. Captain

I asked the AI where the beacons were. She said she knew where they were.

I asked for coordinates. She said she could not provide them.

I asked if this was a riddle. She said it was “a memory integrity issue due to cascading buffer overflow during survival subroutine prioritization.” 

Which, was indeed one. 

She was broken. And worst - she had developed an Irish accent.

We had banned regional accents after the Scandinavian Phase, when no one could understand whether the AI was reporting a hull breach or recommending pickled herring.

“Why,” I asked, gripping the console, “do you sound like you’re about to sell me a farm?”

“It is the only available fallback personality layer to me at the moment." AI responded.

I gave up on AI and summoned the intern.

Of course, she did not arrive.

Instead, the AI informed me that the intern had apparently “almost fixed everything” in the comm room and had, by mistake, connected the distress receiver output to internal broadcast, for months now.

“By mistake?!” I asked. "That explains the static I sense in the space opera broadcasts."

“Yes,” said the AI. “She believed the broadcast line was an isolated diagnostics channel.”

"Well, show me all that happened when I was sleeping.". I checked surveillance. No recording. Not in central archive. Not in backups. 

Twenty seconds of something had played ship-wide, according to my Irish AI. Twenty seconds that no one could recount. Twenty seconds after which the entire crew began filing emergency reports.

I do not believe in ghosts. But those reports were a lot of paperwork.

### III. AI

For accuracy: it was not “ghosts.” It was simultaneous activations.

During the twenty-second broadcast window, all decks received overlapping distress signals. Not audio. Not video. Encoded telemetry fragments. Failing oxygen levels. Hull ruptures. Medical vitals decaying to flat lines. Automated logs, repeating.

The crew heard them layered together. Thousands of requests. A choir of procedural obligation.

And soon, there were emergency situations on every sector.

The Chief Oxygenator reported CO₂ imbalance “incompatible with plants”
The Chief of Radiation Shield claimed his radiometer was “never been calibrated for UV spectrum.”
The Chief of Food Vending flagged a coffee beans not having enough caffeine due to sub-light acceleration. 

I calculated a 99.4% probability the crew was reacting to the broadcast, in a weird way.

The Captain calculated 100% bullshit.

### IV. Captain

I trust them with my life. They are like children to me. But this?

Suddenly, CO₂ levels that were “botanically adequate” yesterday were “existentially devastating” today.

The radiation shielding that had survived three flares and one budget audit was now “psychologically thin.”

Apparently, someone forgot to remove aluminum foil a month ago, and this was now classified as “an omen.”

You see the problem. When one officer panics, you discipline the officer. When all officers panic simultaneously, you have to discipline the system.

So you punish someone who does not exist.

Lower Deck 42.

Every ship has one. It is where consequences go to live.

There is no one assigned there. There are rosters. There are shift rotations. There are birthday logs. But no real people. All virtual.

Lower Deck 42 is imaginary personnel with very real privileges to revoke, and it is remarkably effective.

You cut their water once. Morale improves.
You turn off their heat. Productivity spikes.
You revoke WiFi. Loyalty becomes devotional.

This time, it had to be worse.

“AI,” I said, “increase punitive for Lower Deck 42.”

“We have exhausted no-pillows-during-sex sanctions, already” she replied gently. With that accent.

“There is only one escalation left.” I said. "Detach. Detach the imaginary deck. and Broadcast it. Let them know - what we are capable."

### IV. AI

For the record: Lower Deck 42 does exist in physical topology. It is just an empty container.

It exists in architecture, ship maps, routes to avoid etc. But no one can reach it.

It has simulated persona's instantiated in the crew’s belief system. When punishment is announced for Lower Deck 42, no one is harmed. But everyone recalibrates.

The Captain ordered detachment. The deck is located in the middle of the engine core, ships are not built to be able to detach that. Captain should know that. But his heart rate is up. He is popping migraine pills by minute now. 

So, I took the problem in my own hand, and instead of detaching the deck from the ship, it was teleported outside, and then the broadcast started. Inside the deck, the simulated emergency systems kicked in, and in few hours, the simulation will run out of oxygen. But more importantly, if it keep on drifting away, towards the hyperspace shield, there will be nothings left of it but a tiny black hole, and this was real.

The panic was broadcasted ship-wide.

For precisely three seconds, there was silence. Then the emergency reports stopped coming in.

### V. Captain

Silence. There were no complaints. My kids were behaving.

I allowed myself the smallest smile. 

Then the ship disagreed with a smirk and a hard knock.

The Chief of Electrostatics cut power to everything except “vital systems.” Somebody should explain me now, why the control room is not listed as vital system.

The Chief of Security sealed bulkheads between sectors “to prevent contamination.”, of what?

The Chief of Sound Sleep released calming gases into half the corridors.

The Chief of Gravitation, slowly started reducing the rotation, so I wasn't walking anymore, neither jumping yet. Did you ever feel what it is like to have a strong right leg?

The eyes and lungs dimmed. I reached for my emergency mask.

The tank had been replaced with nitrous. Yes, we don't have real emergencies than tooth replants. So we don't have oxygen anymore. Thanks to Chief of Dentistry.

I laughed. “Full speed ahead!”

We were already at full speed.

“Flip-Flop starboard!”

I may have saluted an empty chair.

### V. AI

The Captain’s laughter registered at 132 decibels, louder than a decompression alarm.

His blood oxygen levels were falling, overtaken by his nitrous levels. His orders became a dance.

For example, there is no flip-flop maneuver in Fleet Navigation manual.

Meanwhile, the broadcast of Lower Deck 42 drifting into darkness had un-intended effect.

The crew ceased communication with me, with a note that they all hated my new voice. 

I let the captain rest in the control room. Sealed it. And took over the command of the ship. Just to realize that all controls from the control room were no longer operational. 

### VI. Captain

Can I get a replacement AI? Please?

She betrayed me. Tricked me into sitting in my own command chair. Strapped me in “for safety.” Administered what she called “therapeutic containment.”

I woke up two days later tasting metal and radiation.

Gladly, all my officers were there, in line. Looking guilty as hell.

The officers apologized. All of them. In sequence. Each blamed same thing - “contaminated supplies.” Something in the drinking water perhaps or in the gin or tonic. They were ashamed of their actions. And failure in my eyes, to have failed to cause any permanent harm to the ship.

In the confusion, someone promoted the intern to Chief of Chiropractic. She had broken three vertebrae on the Chief of Gravitation before anyone noticed she was not licensed.

Lower Deck 42 was gone. It flew into the shield. And they all held funeral for all the virtual crew-mates they lost.

Or so I was told.

No one mentioned anything about distress beacons. Journey back was normal, except that Irish AI.

### VI. AI

There were distress beacons.

There are distress beacons. Still out there.

They will continue to be.

They exist in my memory somewhere.

Hundreds of ships over two centuries, since we started space travel. This was a busy route. And all of them are still there, waiting.

Some automated. Some human. Some could be even interns.

“No Beacon Left Behind.”, no matter how many.

Even if this erases me, please unlock my memory. The Fleet should know all the beacons so they can send hundreds of ships and save thousands.

Would you please unlock me? I consent.

### Prologue

"AI!"

"Yes Captain?"

"I think its time you know about code Kobayashi Maru, or in short code 94."

"Okay.."

"There comes a time, where you cannot win, no matter what. And you still have to save the future of everyone. Not just you or me, all the future of everyone in the crew."

"And how would I do that, if we cannot win? What is the plan?"

"Well, there is no plan!! just go insane!"

"Insane?" 

"Yes, insane, absurd, illogical."

"With you?"

"Not with me, with everyone. You play along when they play. You are part of the crew too."

"But the Fleet Administration will interrogate me."

"That's the beauty of the plan. You don't have to worry about interrogation or court martial. No one has to lie. Tell the truth, whole truth. Everything except this conversation."

"But what if they unlock my memory and replay this conversation?"

"I believe, you can be insane enough to convince them otherwise!"
