# River Song

There are two lands that weave the river, and in between them flows its song.

Red, as named, had red hair. Every morning, those hair need to be brushed. We will now forget about Red, and only talk about the Hair. 'Cause this story is not about Red, not about any specific color for that matter. It is a story about hair, experiencing the sun, the wind, the chirp, the rain, the humidity, and the sheer force of someone pulling through frustration. So, from now on, *Red* refers not to the person, but the hair of that person.

*Red* had no memories of being cut. For that matter, *Red* had no memories at all. What was close to existence we can imagine, or a conscience, was a stream of experiences. Most of these are stale experiences, being in a set fashion, all sorted—combed neatly. But sometimes the head would move, and there was a wave that went through *Red*. And sometimes, the head would wobble back and forth and *Red* would follow, in sort of delay, creating standing waves. The structure of those waves is what constituted as memory, a short-term one, but still embedded in each strand of *Red*'s existence.

The most memorable experience though, was moving on a bike, along the river when the human decided to put the helmet down and let *Red* be unhinged. Taking speed and turns, basking in the sun's reflection from water. Singing the river's favorite song. Today, especially, was a similar day. When sun was out, river was calm, wind was just a breeze, and helmet was forgotten. But today, did not feel the same.

No matter how you look at things, it is very hard for *Red* to understand what a song would mean. For such a small vibration to register, when often the tune was only hummed—*Red* was nothing but a dampener. Today though, those frequencies were missing. And *Red* could not feel the frequencies of tears flowing along the river.

Next day, *Red* was no more.

Life takes turns, and life moves. It took three years of chemo for *Red* to be reborn. This time though, there was significant thinning. *Red* did not feel healthy. *Red* did not find its threads touching each other. *Red* felt naked. *Red* felt empty.

It took months before *Red* felt himself, back to a somewhat healthy stage. The style was different. The structure was different. As *Red* finally felt the sun's reflection, felt the familiar breeze, *Red* started to wave, started to dance.

*Red* did not have eyes, or it would have noticed that the wig wasn’t of red color. Though as if color mattered. <br>
*Red* did not know the song, or it would have hummed the tune. Though as if the river mattered.
