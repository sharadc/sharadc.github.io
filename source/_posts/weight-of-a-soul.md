I could see people's souls for as long as I can remember.
Not as halos or beams, just an aura that comes with them, everywhere they go.

Do animals have souls? Of course.
Do cats have nine? Maybe, but to me they look like one.
Trees? Yes. You bet.
Does size matter? I believe so. Once, under a microscope, I saw the aura of a paramecium.

When I was a kid, other kids drew people with stick limbs—faces, expressions, hands. All I could focus on was the aura: a blob, an oval, an egg-shape field. 

It was easy to draw my friends. Light blue, teal, orange, bright green—blots on the page. They loved it. Does the aura have a color? No. I picked them colors, I liked colors.

Drawing myself was harder. I could never see my own soul.
Mirrors don’t reflect it. Cameras don’t catch it.
I searched for it, for a long time. Now, I’ve made peace with not knowing. 

I imagine mine as an average, about the shape and size of my friends and family.

What happens when you die?

I noticed it first with my friend, when she said goodbye to her dog. Her aura suddenly grew thicker. Then it happened to my mom when her grandmother passed. And slowly it clicked, you give pieces of your soul to the people you love.

Maybe there is no heaven or hell. Or maybe, heaven or hell is with the people you loved.

Do souls have weight?

Imagine carrying the souls of everyone who ever loved you. It is a one-sided decision, isn’t it? Being forced to carry their legacy.
Wouldn’t it drag you down? It would, if souls had weight.

But the egg of aura is always upside down. It can become dense, but it’s always a flipped oval—like a balloon, reaching to the sky.

Souls have buoyancy.

Maybe in the gravity or Maybe it’s the magnetic poles or Maybe cause of the air itself. Whatever the reason, the aura always wants to rise.

So you can hold all who loved you, within you.

And float.
